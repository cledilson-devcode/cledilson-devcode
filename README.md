### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cledilson, a 28-year-old Brazilian who constantly seeks responsibilities and commitments that bring meaning to my journey. I embarked on my professional path in the telemarketing industry, but soon found my true calling in the field of Software Development.

My journey led me to dive into the realm of REST API development, where I apply my expertise in the Java language and the Spring Boot framework to create projects. I have knowledge in API documentation and use Swagger to ensure this.

To ensure the quality and integrity of my work, I employ the approach of integration testing using JUnit. My expertise doesn't stop there; it encompasses both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). Additionally, I use Docker for API deployment and operations.
